        <h1>About Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>
                These terms should be used only where the therapy service is to be provided to a customer who is a “consumer” as defined in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (i.e. an individual who receives the service for his/her personal use and for purposes wholly or mainly outside the purposes of any business of that individual or another). The terms are suitable for use where the contract is an “on premises”, “off premises” or “distance” contract as defined in the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013. The Regulations require you to supply certain information to customers who are consumers before they book an appointment. Where the contract is an “off premises” or “distance” contract, the Regulations also confer on the customer certain rights to cancel a booking and we have set these out in the terms themselves.
