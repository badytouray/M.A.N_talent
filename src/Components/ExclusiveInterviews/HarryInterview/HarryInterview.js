              intro="
              Jungle legends don’t come any bigger than Harry Shotta. A selector. A label owner. An record shop innovator. An ambassador.
              
              Drum&BassArena blog regular Jamie S23 had the chance to interview him last week. This is how it went down…
              
              Surprisingly Nicky doesn’t really do interviews. What with having five children and a global DJ schedule, his free time is minimal. With such a rare window, it’s difficult to know where to start. I decided to start with a personal favourite ‘Geese Tune’."
              
              q1="What do you think of Bady1"
              answer1="He’s right: it was really a label for everyone at the time. Kartoons ended in 2000. Nicky confirms that the label “had pretty much run its course” although this may not be the end for Kartoons…. I suggested that it may be an idea to remix some of the classics from the label and to my amazement this was answered with a big “YES! I don’t see a better time than the present to think about remixing some of the tracks from Kartoons”.
              
              Rave memories
              Next up for discussion were some of the big events of the mid ‘90s. Dreamscape 20 in particular, alongside 5ive-O and Moose. Nicky recalls the event as “some bloody massive rave in tents near Northampton.” For those unfamiliar, Dreamscape were run by the late Murray Beetson who Nicky described as “an innovator of the rave scene, someone who set down the foundations for underground music as we now know it”. We spoke about how legendary the set from this event really was and it was certainly refreshing when Nicky seems quite lost for words."

              q2="how does he cook2"
              answer2="Helter Skelter Energy 97 was the next big set that I wanted to talk about. Stevie Hyper D was causing mayhem everywhere he performed. Nicky instantly recalls his renowned lyric “mena-mena-move your body, move your body plenty”.
              
              “This was around the time Stevie (god rest his soul) was coming to every dance with me,” says Nicky. “He would literally turn up and destroy the place.”
              
              Pirate time
              Although information relating to Nicky Blackmarket’s past is pretty scarce on the internet, I did manage to retrieve some early information relating to Pulse FM and the early days of pirate radio. It turns out, though, that this wasn’t his first venture into radio. Friends FM came way before it."
